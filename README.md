# ðŸŒŒ Orbital Mechanics Visualiser

A Python-based simulator to visualize 3D orbital mechanics using Newtonian gravity. Built with `pygame` and `numpy`.

---

## ðŸ§  Why I Built This

Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by space, so I decided to explore how gravity and orbital dynamics work by building something myself.

This project helped me understand:
- How gravitational forces behave
- How orbits are formed
- How to simulate physical systems using code

---

## ðŸŽ® Features

- Simulates gravitational interaction between bodies
- Real-time 2D orbit calculation
- Adjustable object mass, position, and velocity
- Traces paths and visualizes motion using `pygame`

How It Works
Applies Newtonâ€™s Law of Universal Gravitation:
F = G * (m1 * m2) / rÂ²

Computes velocity and position updates per time step

Visualizes orbit paths using 2D rendering in Pygame

Uses basic physics and numerical methods
